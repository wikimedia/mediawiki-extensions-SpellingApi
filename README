SpellingApi
===========

This MediaWiki extension provides an API for checking the spelling
of a given text using the ASpell/pspell libraries.
Support for other spelling engines will hopefully be added later.

Dependencies:
* The pspell package for PHP must be installed on the server
  (Fedora: php-pspell; Ubuntu: php5-pspell).
* The dictionary packages for each language that you want
  check must be installed on the server. The Fedora and Ubuntu
  packages are usually called aspell-CODE, for example aspell-hi
  for Hindi, aspell-fr for Frech etc.
